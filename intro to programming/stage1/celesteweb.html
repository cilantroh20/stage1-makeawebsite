		<div class="me"><p><em>Welcome to my page, I'm <b>Celeste</b>. I first started dabbling with programming 	
			when myspace first came out. I don't really remember my age, but I do remember I was in seventh grade. It wasn't anything to crazy, I would just view the source code of layouts that I found on the internet,and make a few adjustments to the things that I didn't like. A year and a half ago, I taught myself the basics of HTML & CSS. I knew I
			wanted a career that had something to do with programming. Coincidentally, a friend
			told me about Udacity's programs.</em>
